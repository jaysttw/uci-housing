# UCI Housing Dataset with simple Flask frontend
This project consists of 2 Jupyter notebooks analysing the UCI Housing dataset to produce a model predicting the \
prices of housing in the (simplified compared to the original) dataset. The frontend provides a way to interact with \
the model obtained from the analysis, by providing a HTTP POST endpoint at `/predict`, returning the predictions as a \
JSON.
